      "Body": "Image copyright\nAFP\nImage caption\nPopulists poised to govern: Five Star Movement's Luigi Di Maio (L) and League's Matteo Salvini\nItaly's two populist parties are preparing to set the eurozone's third biggest economy on a path of tax cuts, a guaranteed basic income for the poor and deportations of 500,000 migrants.\nThe anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right-wing League reject years of EU austerity and want to renegotiate Italy's debt.\nThey have named law professor Giuseppe Conte to lead the government. If the president gives them the green light it will then be for parliament to decide.\nBut what will a Five Star-League government mean for Italy and the rest of Europe?\nThese are, after all, Eurosceptic parties - yet Italy was in at the start of what became the European Union.\nItaly's future in the euro\nNeither Five Star nor The League are fans of the single currency. League leader Matteo Salvini said not long ago that the euro was \"a mistake\" for Italy's economy, while Five Star had wanted a referendum on Italy's future membership.\nBut they have dropped their initial ambition of exit from the euro and now talk of trying to reform it from within.\nNot everyone is convinced by their change of heart. France's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire earned a rebuke from the leader of The League by warning the populist parties to respect Italy's budget commitments.\nThe markets are wary, too. Italy's borrowing costs have touched levels not seen since 2016.\nWhat do populist parties plan for Italy?\nItaly was ravaged by the 2008 financial crisis that left the economy some 6% smaller and three million more people in poverty.\nThe answer for The League and Five Star is to move Italians out of poverty. But their policies will cost tens of billions of euros, for a country with the second biggest public debt in the EU after Greece. It stands at 132% of national output.\nGuaranteed income for the poor\nPoor families will get a \u20ac780 (£682; $919) basic monthly income, provided recipients actively seek work, the parties say.\nIt is a popular idea but one that will cost an estimated \u20ac17bn to implement.\nTwo income tax rates\nIts most expensive policy is the idea of two \"flat tax\" rates set at 15% and 20%.\nFamilies would receive a \u20ac3,000 annual tax deduction based on household income. Sales and excise tax increases next year, worth \u20ac12.5bn, will be scrapped.\nThe 58-page joint pact, or \"contract\", does not explain how all the extra spending will be financed. But economists estimate it could cost some \u20ac50bn in lost revenue.\nPension reform\nThe minimum monthly pension is to be set at \u20ac780.\nThe plan abolishes the current pension reform that raises the retirement age in phases.\nInstead, a new points system would combine people's total years of social security contributions with their age. The total must be at least 100, meaning that someone who has paid into the system for 41 years, for example, could retire at 59.\nCutting Italy's debt\nThe populist parties say they want revisions to the EU's Stability and Growth Pact, which sets a tough budget deficit limit of 3% of GDP.\nThe plan aims to reduce debt through \"the revival of internal demand\", not by continuing austerity.\nMass deportations\nItaly's populists are not just aiming to reset the economy and revisit the EU's rules on debt. The League is strongly anti-immigration and their joint plan reflects that.\nIt demands more EU help for Italy, the main destination for migrants arriving from North Africa. And it insists that the estimated 500,000 undocumented migrants in Italy must be deported \"as a priority\".\nItalian election: Its economy in charts\nWhat exactly is populism?\nThat would require the creation of \"temporary stay facilities\" throughout Italy for migrants earmarked for expulsion, the parties say.\nImage copyright\nAFP\nImage caption\nItaly's capacity to house migrants has been stretched to the limits\nThe plan calls for effective relocation of asylum-seekers EU-wide - a scheme already rejected by some EU states. And it demands stronger co-operation to fight people-smuggling gangs.\nReaching out to Russia\nThe populist leaders disagree with the EU sanctions on Russia and want them lifted. They do not see Russia as a military threat, but as \"a potential partner for the EU and Nato\".\nThey want to work with Russia against the smuggling of migrants across the Mediterranean and the continuing influence of violent Islamists. They also see Russia as a key player in ending the wars in the Middle East.\nThe EU and US accuse Russia of hostile anti-Western activities and relations became icy after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014."
